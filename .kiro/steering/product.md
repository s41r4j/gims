# GIMS - Git Made Simple

GIMS is an AI-powered Git CLI tool that automatically generates meaningful commit messages from code changes. It's designed to replace generic commit messages with descriptive, professional ones that tell a story.

## Core Value Proposition
- Eliminates the need to write commit messages manually
- Uses AI (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Groq) to analyze code diffs and generate contextual messages
- Provides a streamlined Git workflow with single-command operations
- Supports both local and remote operations with intelligent fallbacks

## Key Features
- AI-powered commit message generation from code diffs
- One-command workflow: analyze, commit, and push (`g o`)
- Smart suggestions with clipboard integration (`g s`)
- Conventional Commits support
- Numbered commit history and branch management
- Safe operations with confirmations and dry-run support
- Graceful fallbacks for large diffs and offline use

## Target Users
Developers who want to maintain clean Git history without spending time crafting commit messages, especially those working on projects where commit message quality matters for collaboration and code review.
